# BlockBookBinder
_A simple utility for preparing and pasting large texts into Minecraft books._

This application was developed in order to make the production of written books in Minecraft easier, by splitting up large texts into pre-formatted chunks that are automatically loaded onto the user's clipboard for pasting into the book.

## Using Block Book Binder

To get started, look for the **Releases** section on this page, and find the latest release. Download the executable JAR file and you're ready to go. Simply paste some plain text into the _Source_ panel on the right-hand side, and press the button _Convert to Book_ to process that text into a series of pages which will appear on the left-hand side.

Once you're happy with how the pages are formatted, you can click the _Export_ button to begin exporting pages to your clipboard. Once you give an affirmative response to the confirmation popup that appears, the first page will be loaded into your clipboard. You can then use `CTRL + V` to paste the page into your book. Each time you do, the program will take about a second to load the next page into your clipboard, so that you can paste it without even having to leave your game.
